# Webly Project

**A set of lightweight libraries focused on simplicity for building simple web applications.**

Webly Project is a modular web development ecosystem that provides simple building blocks for creating modern web applications.  
It focuses on clarity, composability, and control, without forcing a monolithic framework or complex tooling.

Webly is designed to be adopted incrementally. Each library can be used independently or combined to form a complete application architecture.

## Documentation

📖 **Web Documentation**  
https://pebrianz.github.io/webly-project

The documentation is generated using TypeDoc and organized by package.  
Each package documents its public APIs, usage examples, and design constraints.

---

## Goals

- Make web development easy and approachable
- Reduce unnecessary abstraction and boilerplate
- Provide clear and predictable reactive primitives
- Enable modular adoption without lock-in
- Maintain strong TypeScript support with minimal verbosity

---

## Packages

Webly is organized as a mono-repo containing independent libraries:

- **@webly/rebind**  
  Reactive primitives and data binding foundations

- **@webly/router**  
  Lightweight routing

Each package can be used independently.

---

## Design Principles

- **Modular**  
  Libraries are independent, optional, and composable.

- **Minimal surface area**  
  APIs are small, focused, and easy to reason about.

- **Framework-agnostic**  
  Webly does not require a specific build tool or framework.

---

## Non-Goals

Webly does not aim to:
- Replace existing frameworks entirely
- Enforce a single architectural style

---


Webly Project is under active development.  
APIs may evolve until a stable release is announced.
